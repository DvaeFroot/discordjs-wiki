# DiscordJS
My own version of a discord bot guide to help me understand the concepts better. While there exists an official DiscordJS guide, it omits a lot of things. It assumes you understand the setup and proceeds onward with the more advanced concepts which always left my head scratching. This guide is created by learning from different sources especially from youtube as well as imparting my own thoughts since this guide is ==tailor-made== for myself.
